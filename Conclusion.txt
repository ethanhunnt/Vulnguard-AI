1. For now when relevant code statements based on data flow are given then it is able to predict the BO correctly

2. It has some tolerance for non argument related statements which are not part of data flow 

3. code and code1 are files that are example of statement 2

4. sprintf is for some reason trained as not vulnerable at all 

5. Overall needs more training including non-dataflow related statements as a part of the training, basically train using control flow
